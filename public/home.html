        <p>This is a site dedicated to my attempts at making an audio visualizer, my pet project.
		<br>
		<br>
		   Ever since I played AudioSurf and saw how cool it was as an audio visualizer I wanted to 
		   make something like that as a visualizer.
		<br>
		   To preface, I love art and I love music, but I'm a novice at best when it comes to both.
		   That hasn't stopped me from trying though. I've been learning about music and color to make 
		   this site, which suites me just fine. So keep and eye out because I'm making progress all the 
		   time.</p>
